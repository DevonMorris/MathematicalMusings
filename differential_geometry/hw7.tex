\section*{Problem 1}%

Denote by $(u,v)$ the cartesian coordinates of $\mathds{R}^2$. Show that the function $\varphi: U \rightarrow \mathds{R}^3$ given by 
\[
  \varphi(u,v) = (f(v) \cos u, f(v) \sin(u), g(v)),
\]
\[
  U = \left\{ (u,v) \in \mathds{R}^2: u_0 < u < u_1; v_0 < v < v_1 \right\},
\]
where $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions, with $f'(v)^2 + g'(v)^2 \neq 0$ and $f(v) \neq 0$, is an immersion. The image $\varphi(U)$ is the surface generated by the rotation of the curve $(f(v), g(v))$ around the axis $0z$ and is called a surface of revolution $S$. The image by $\varphi$ of the curves $u = $ constant and $v = constant$ are called meridians and parallels, respectively, of $S$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Show that the induced metric in the coordinates $(u,v)$ is given by 
    \[
      g_{11} = f^2, \quad g_{12} = 0, g_{22} = (f')^2 + (g')^2
    \]
  \item Show that the local equations of a geodesic $\gamma$ are
    \[
      \begin{aligned}
        &\dv[2]{u}{t} + \frac{2 ff'}{f^2} \dv{u}{t} \dv{v}{t} = 0 \\
        &\dv[2]{v}{t} - \frac{ff'}{(f')^2 + (g')^2} \left( \dv{u}{t} \right)^2 + \frac{f'f'' + g'g''}{(f')^2 + (g')^2} \left( \dv{v}{t} \right)^2 = 0
      \end{aligned}
    \]
  \item Obtain the following geometric meaning of the equations above: the second equation is, except for meridians and parallels, equivalent to the fact that the "energy" $|\gamma'(t)|^2$ of a geodesic is constant along $\gamma$; the first equation signifies that if $\beta(t)$ is the oriented angle, $\beta(t) < \pi$, of $\gamma$ with a parallel $P$ intersection $\gamma$ at $\gamma(t)$, then 
    \[
      r \cos \beta = \text{const.}
    \]
    where $r$ is the radius of the parallel $P$.
  \item Use Clairaut's relation to show that a geodesic of the paraboloid
    \[
      (f(v) = v, g(v) = v^2, 0 < v < \infty, -\epsilon < u < 2\pi + \epsilon)
    \]
    which is not a meridian, intersects itself an infinite number of times.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}[Solution.]
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item First we note that in local coordinates the differential under this chart is given by
      \[
        \begin{bmatrix}
          -f(v)\sin u &  f'(v) \cos(u) \\
          f(v) \cos u & f'(v) \sin(u) \\
          0 & g'(v)
        \end{bmatrix}
      \]
      which implies that
      \[
        d \varphi \pdv{u} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
          -f(v) \sin u \\
          f(v) \cos u \\
          0
        \end{bmatrix}
        \quad 
        d \varphi \pdv{v} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
          f'(v)\cos(u) \\
          f'(v) \sin(u) \\
          g'(v)
        \end{bmatrix}
      \]
      where the local coordinates on $\mathds{R}^3$ are given by the identity map. Using the standard metric on $\mathds{R}^3$ we have
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          g_{11} &= f^2(v) \left( \sin^2 u + \cos^2 u \right) = f^2(v) \\
          g_{12} &= -f(v)\sin u f'(v)\cos u + f(v)\cos u f'(v) \sin u = 0 \\
          g_{22} &= (f'(v))^2(\cos^2 u + \sin^2 u) + (g'(v))^2 = (f'(v))^2 + (g'(v))^2
        \end{aligned}
      \]
    \item To do this we first need to find the levi-civita connection and the associated christoffel symbols. We have that $\Gamma_{12}^k = \Gamma_{21}^k$ since we are using the levi civita connection, so we will first take partial derivatives
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          &\pdv{g_{11}}{u} = 0 \quad &\pdv{g_{11}}{v} = 2ff' \\
          &\pdv{g_{12}}{u} = 0 \quad &\pdv{g_{12}}{v} = 0 \\
          &\pdv{g_{22}}{u} =  0 \quad &\pdv{g_{22}}{v} = 2f'f'' + 2g'g''
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      Thus we have that
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \Gamma^1_{11} &= \frac{1}{2}g^{11} \left(\pdv{g_{11}}{u} + \pdv{g_{11}}{u} - \pdv{g_{11}}{u}  \right) = 0 \\
          \Gamma^1_{12} &= \frac{1}{2}g^{11} \left(\pdv{g_{11}}{v} + \pdv{g_{12}}{u} - \pdv{g_{11}}{u}  \right) = \frac{ff'}{f^2} \\
          \Gamma^1_{22} &= \frac{1}{2}g^{11} \left(\pdv{g_{12}}{v} + \pdv{g_{12}}{v} - \pdv{g_{22}}{u}  \right) = 0 \\
          \Gamma^2_{11} &= \frac{1}{2}g^{22} \left(\pdv{g_{12}}{u} + \pdv{g_{12}}{u} - \pdv{g_{11}}{v}  \right) = -\frac{ff'}{(f')^2 + (g')^2} \\
          \Gamma^2_{12} &= \frac{1}{2}g^{22} \left(\pdv{g_{12}}{v} + \pdv{g_{22}}{u} - \pdv{g_{12}}{v}  \right) = 0 \\
          \Gamma^2_{22} &= \frac{1}{2}g^{22} \left(\pdv{g_{22}}{v} + \pdv{g_{22}}{v} - \pdv{g_{22}}{v}  \right) = \frac{f'f'' + g'g''}{(f')^2 + (g')^2} \\
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      So we have the following 
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \dv[2]{u}{t} + \left(\dv{u}{t}\right) \Gamma_{11}^1 + 2\dv{u}{t}\dv{v}{t} \Gamma_{12}^1 + \left(\dv{v}{t}\right)\Gamma_{22}^1 &= \dv[2]{u}{t} + \frac{2ff'}{f^2} \dv{u}{t}\dv{v}{t} = 0 \\
          \dv[2]{v}{t} + \left(\dv{u}{t}\right) \Gamma_{11}^2 + 2\dv{u}{t}\dv{v}{t} \Gamma_{12}^2 + \left(\dv{v}{t}\right)\Gamma_{22}^2 &= \dv[2]{v}{t} - \frac{ff'}{(f')^2 + (g')^2} \left(\dv{u}{t}\right)^2 + \frac{f'f'' + g'g''}{(f')^2 + (g')^2}\left( \dv{v}{t} \right)^2 = 0 \\
        \end{aligned}
      \]
    \item Consider the energy given by
      \[
        |\gamma'(t)|^2 = f^2 \left(\dv{u}{t}\right)^2 + ((f')^2 + (g')^2) \left(\dv{v}{t}\right)^2
      \]
      Taking the time derivative of this quantity yields
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          2ff' \left( \dv{u}{t} \right)^2 \dv{v}{t} &+ 2 f^2 \dv{u}{t} \dv[2]{u}{t} +  (2f'f'' + 2g'g'') \left(\dv{v}{t}\right)^3  + 2((f')^2 + (g')^2) \dv{v}{t} \dv[2]{v}{t} \\
                                                    &= 2\dv{u}{t}\left( 2 ff' \dv{u}{t} + f^2 \dv[2]{u}{t} \right) + 2\dv{v}{t} \left( ((f')^2 + (g')^2) \dv[2]{v}{t} + (f'f'' + g'g'')\left(\dv{v}{t}\right) - ff' \left(\dv{u}{t}\right)^2 \right) \\
                                                    &= 0
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      So we have that the energy is constant. Now we note that along any parallel $P$ that the component of the tangent vector along $\pdv{v}$ must be zero. Without loss of generality assume that the tangent vector is given by$h(u)\pdv{u}$. We now wish to compute $r \cos \beta$. We first note that the radius is given by $f$, now we compute $\cos \beta$. Let $k = |\gamma'(t)|$, which must be constant, we have that
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \cos \beta &=  \inn*{\dv{u}{t} \pdv{u} + \dv{v}{t} \pdv{v}}{h(u)\pdv{u}}/ h(u)kf\\
                     &=  \frac{f}{k} \dv{u}{t}
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      Now let's take the time derivative of $f \cos \beta = \frac{f^2}{k} \dv{u}{t}$, and we get
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          2\frac{ff'}{k}\dv{u}{t}\dv{v}{t} + \frac{f^2}{k} \dv[2]{u}{t} = \frac{f^2}{k} \left(\dv[2]{u}{t} + 2\frac{ff'}{f^2}\dv{u}{t}\dv{v}{t}\right) = 0
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      by the first equation. Therefore, we must have that
      \[
        r \cos \beta = \text{const.}
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 2}%
A subset $A$ of a differential manifold $M$ is contractible to a point $a \in A$ when the mapping $\text{id}_A$ and $k_a: x \in A \rightarrow a \in M$ are homotopic (with base point $a$). $A$ is contractible if it is contractible to one of its points.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item Show that a convex neighborhood in a Riemannian manifold $M$ is a contractible subset (with respect to any of its points).
  \item Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold. Show that there exists a covering $\left\{ U_\alpha \right\}$ of $M$ with the following properties
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
      \item $U_\alpha$ is open and contractible, for each $\alpha$
      \item If $U_{\alpha_1}, \dots, U_{\alpha_r}$ are elements of the convering then $\cap_1^r U_{\alpha_i}$ is contractible.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Let $D$ be a convex neighborhood and let $d \in D$. Given and $p \neq d$, $p \in D$, we have that there exists a $\gamma_p$ such that
      \[
        q = \gamma_q(1, d, v_q)
      \]
      Thus let us analyze the function given by 
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \kappa: &[0,1] \times D \rightarrow D \\
                  &(t,q) \mapsto \gamma_q(1 - t, d, v_q) 
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      We note that this map is continuous and $\kappa(0, q) = q$ and $\kappa(1,q) = d$. Therefore we have that $D$ is contractible to a point $d$. Since $d$ was arbitrary we have that $D$ is contractible.
    \item For any $p \in M$ there exists an $\epsilon(p) > 0$ such that $B_{\epsilon(p)}(p)$ is strongly convex. By part a) we showed that this set is contractible. Also it must be open since $\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism on this set. Furthemore $\left\{ B_{\epsilon(p)}(p) \right\}$ covers $M$ by definition. Consider $\cap_1^r B_{\epsilon(p_i)}(p_i)$, in the case that it is empty we will say that it is contractible. If this intersection is nonempty, we have that there is some $q$ in this intersection. In this case $B_{\epsilon(q)}(q)$ contains the intersection meaning that by necessity the intersection is a convex neighborhood of $q$ therefore by part a) it must be contractible.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
